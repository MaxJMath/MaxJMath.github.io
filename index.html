    Hi! My name is Max Johnson, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego advised by Zhouli Xu and Robert Burklund. My interests include an array of subjects under the umbrella of homotopy theory tied together by an interest in computational (stable) homotopy theory and applications to more classical problems in algebraic topology. I am also interested in the relationships between arithmetic geometry, algebraic K-theory, and chromatic homotopy theory.
