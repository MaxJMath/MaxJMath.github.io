    Hi! My name is Max Johnson, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego advised by Zhouli Xu and Robert Burklund. My interests include a vast array of subjects under the umbrella of homotopy theory, but are all tied together by an interest in computational (stable) homotopy theory. Recently my work has focused on the recently developing methods around "deformations" of the category of Spectra by various spectral sequences. I am also interested in the relationships between arithmetic geometry, algebraic K-theory, and chromatic homotopy theory.
