    Hi! My name is Max Johnson, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego advised by Zhouli Xu and Robert Burklund. My interests include a vast array of subjects under the umbrella of homotopy theory, but are all tied together by an interest in computational (stable) homotopy theory. Recently my work has focused on the recently developing methods around "deformations" of the category of Spectra by various spectral sequences. I am also interested in the relationships between arithmetic geometry, algebraic K-theory, and chromatic homotopy theory.

<p>This website is (obviously) a work in progress. Eventually it will contain links to my CV and any preprints / publications I put out. For now, I am working on a blog wherein I choose a paper or concept every month to write expository about. The "posts" are just download links to PDFs, which is easier than trying to use any of the online LaTeX setups, without actually being any harder to read (in my opinion).</p>
