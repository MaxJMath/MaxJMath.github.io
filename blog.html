Reader Beware: I write these mostly for fun / my own learning. I would be elated to learn that others find them useful; however, I do not promise they are error-free. I try to be careful to cite everything I mention, but if you feel that your own work or someone elses is missing a citation, please let me know! In particular, I make no claim that anything in the blog is original.
